Please feel free to look into the codebase.

I honestly think that the performance and reliability is very high.
Connectors:
Coinbase : 100%
Blinktrade: 100% except taker orders
BFX: No orders managements
HitBTC: should be ok except taker orders but I did not run it for long as the volume there happens to be fake.

I am going to add more pictures soon.
